# EdgarRenderer
EDGAR Renderer enables investors to view the interactive data filings submitted under the US Security and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) rules that require the use of XBRL via the SEC website. 

EDGAR Renderer was created by staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Data and content created by government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to 
domestic copyright protection. 17 U.S.C. 105.

End user support is by e-mail direct to SEC at: Ask-OID@sec.gov

Developer issue management is by the Jira Edgar Renderer project: https://arelle.atlassian.net/projects/ER

This is the master branch, as contributed by SEC.  The plugin branch, https://github.com/Arelle/EdgarRenderer/tree/plugin, 
reconfigures SEC's EdgarRenderer as a dynamically installable Arelle plugin.  The plugin provides EdgarRenderer features to existing integrated usage of Arelle by a command 
line interface, by java and c# interface and by RESTful server interface.
